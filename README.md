### Setup
To setup the conda environment to run code locally:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

once the environment is created and the dependencies are installed:
```bash
conda activate mujo
```

this should put you in the environment and make sure that the interpreter for the code is the one in the conda env.
